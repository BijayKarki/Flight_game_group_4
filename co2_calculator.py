# How much is the co2 consumed per km per person?
# 250 kg CO2 per flight hour (https://www.carbonindependent.org/22.html#:~:text=A%20reasonable%20estimate%20for%20aviation,obtained%20by%20Basis%201%20above.)


factor = 1.5  # kg/passenger/100 km of the flight (this is the base assumption for now, which can be modelled to simulate real case in the future!)
